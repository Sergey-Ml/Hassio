[Full Changelog][changelog]

âœ¨ This release adds support for Hass.io Ingress ðŸŽ‰ 

**Breaking change**

The addition of Ingress makes this add-on now accessible directly. If you have added Glances via an iframe panel, this release will break that.

However, you can enable this again by going into the add-on configuration. A new section show is visible: "Network". Enter port `61208` (or anything else if you want) in the `disabled` field. Hit the "SAVE" followed by the "RESTART" button to make your iframe work as before.

An option to add an Ingress capable add-on to the sidebar menu automatically is expected to land in Home Assistant 0.92.

Besides this all, this release mainly contains maintenance upgrades, changes, and improvements.
