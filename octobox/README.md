Take back control of your GitHub notifications.

## About

If you manage more than one active project on GitHub, you probably find GitHub notifications pretty lacking.

Notifications are marked as read and disappear from the list as soon as you load the page or view the email of the notification. This makes it very hard to keep on top of which notifications you still need to follow up on.

Most open source maintainers and GitHub staff end up using a complex combination of filters and labels in Gmail to manage their notifications from their inbox. If you are like me, try to avoid email, then you might want something else.
Octobox is a beautiful application that manages your GitHub notifications via GitHub’s API, allowing you to filter down by organization, project, notification type, or the reason why you are receiving the notification in the first place.

It is easy to drill down into the issues that matter to you in the current moment while still allowing you to be subscribed to projects that you’d like to keep an eye on. You can quickly address threads that you’ve authored yourself or remember that you still need to submit your review that someone requested.
You can “star” long-running issues that you know might be important down the road.

A real must-have for every GitHub opensource contributor.
